I\'ve lived in a large sharehouse in East Melbourne for over 15 years, with more than 100 different people (six at a time), so I\'m pretty familiar with shared living arrangements. I particularly enjoy living with people from overseas, even if only briefly, as I find they tend to bring a cultural diversity to the house and offer a different perspective on life. That having been said, I absolutely love Australia and think Melbourne is the best city in the world, from my subjective perspective, and I very much enjoy showing people around. Some of my interests are philosophy, history and economics while I also love movies and music along with swimming and snowboarding.'
